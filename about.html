                    <h3>Trade offers</h3>
                    <p>
                        Trade offers allow residents to use their earned personal points to exchange goods and services within the community. 
                        Instead of one-to-one bartering, the point system makes trades simple and fair.
                        Residents might offer items like fresh vegetables or a compost bin, or services like sewing repairs, window cleaning, or guided meditation.
                        All available offers are displayed so members can easily see what they can “purchase” with their points.

                    <h4>Green actions</h4>
                    <p>
                        Green actions are individual eco-friendly habits that residents complete to support sustainable living—such as cycling to work, eating vegan for a week, or switching to efficient lighting.
                        Each action contributes points to the community’s shared “climate capital,” encouraging everyone to make greener choices.
                        These actions are shown anonymously on the website, serving as an open catalogue of inspiration rather than a competition.

                    <h4>Milestones</h4>
                    <p>
                        Communal milestones represent the shared tasks that keep Cloverville running smoothly. 
                        This includes activities like preparing communal meals, tidying shared spaces, or maintaining outdoor areas.
                        When residents complete these tasks, they earn personal points as a fair reward for contributing to the community.
                        Recurring tasks give consistent points, while new tasks can be adjusted as needed.
